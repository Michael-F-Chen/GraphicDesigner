GraphicDesigner
===============
a graphic designer developed by extjs4/jquery/raphael.high customizable view bevaviors(delegates)

Hi,everyone.im a web/java/ios developer from China.
recently im developing a Graphic Designer based on ExtJs4.2.x&jQuery&raphael.i think it's a very common thing and 
there're lots of familiar designers throughout the web.
But,u really should look at this,it's very friendly with ur BUSINESS!
    
	> want to build an online visio application?
	yes,ITSELF is!
	> want to draw a workflow template?
	it provides complex validations by extra!
	> want to build up a form designer?
	it can do it excellently!(you can not only find a for designer here, 
		but also a designation->real form instance here!)
  
Graphic Designer has a well-designed mechanism of 'DELEGATE(like plugin)',
when u want 2 add new behaviors 2 a view(i.e. circle/rect/text/path and so on),just write a customized delegate 4 it,and wire it with the view which u want 2 do this!
  
it's a world of delegates!

let's take a look at some screenshots & features!
